# Sailing Simulator

The aim is to have a boat automatically plot a route from A to B depending on where the wind is coming from. This boat will 
then be able to sail from A to B in the fastest possible way adjusting its sails in the process.

When travelling upwind the boat cannot sail directly into the wind, so the boat will have to work out a zig zagged approach to going upwind.
This will also mean that it will have to know when the best time to tack is.

# Improvements to be made:

So far I have the boats travelling around a course, however there still needs to be some improvements. 

When going upwind and downwind the sails need 
to be on the correct side of the boat. 

I also need to add the zig zagged approach to going upwind.

After this I then need to add more specific points of sail such as beam reach etc.
